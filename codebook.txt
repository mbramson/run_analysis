Codebook for the two output files

File 1: totaldata_meanstd.txt

Variables:

subject: Integer 1 to 30. Each Value represents a different human subject. There are 30 subjects
activity: Character with 6 values. These are "WALKING
" "WALKING_UPSTAIRS
" "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
" "SITTING
" "STANDING
" "LAYING"

The following variables are all numbers. They represent mean and standard deviations for the X, Y, and Z, directions.
Readings in the X,Y, and Z directions are denoted with X,Y, and Z accordingly.
mean readings contain "mean()", and standard deviations of readings contain "std()".
Variables without X,Y, or Z in them but containing "Mag" denoted magnitude readings. These are direction agnostic.
additional information about these variables is contained in the feature_info.txt file contained in the subject dataset.

File 2: AggregateAverageData.txt

Subject and Activity columns are the same as described in File 1.
The rest of the variables are also identical to the ones in File 1 with th caveat that they represent the means
of the data points in File 1 split into subject-activity pairings.
